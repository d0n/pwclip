          unfinished - gpg4win only supports gpg-2.0 keys what made me
          confused using it with gpg-2.1-made-keys which is incompatible
          when using ed25519-keys

          catched (unsure if that is compromising somehow anyways)

        * [W] implementing gpg4win giving me a hard time while many
          issues appear which do not exists under linux regarding the
          libraries libusb and yubico and PATH related issues as gpg4win
          does not use C:Users%USER% as home directory for the personal
          .gnupg folder and so on...

3.1 What pwclip is
==================

pwclip is a password management tool.  It’s main target is having fast
and comfortable access to passwords by storing them for a variable time
in the systems clipboard (copy/paste) buffer.

It basically has two operating modes.  One is for operating on yubikeys
to generate uniq responses which might be used as passwords while they
can be generated by that exact yubikey only.  The first yubikey found on
the system and the first slot, configured with (HMAC-SHA1)
challenge-response, will be used.  For that function Windows is
supported (see "Install" section).

The second operating mode does currently only work (as so far tested) on
Linux due to lack of cmdline handling of gpg4win (which i am not sure
about and will go into as soon as i find the time and motivation for
that).  It can be used to create a ~/.pwdcrypt file which is gpg
encrypted text using either the value of GPGKEYS as gpg recipients if
found in environment otherwise every key within the users keyring will
be used.  For password-list managing there is a simple "import"
function.  On startup it lookes for a ~/.pwd.yaml file and if found
merged with the already known passwords from the ~/.passcrypt if there
is one.  All entrys in ~/.passcrypt will be overridden by the entrys
from the ~/.pwd.yaml file.  As soon as it has been merged the
~/.pwd.yaml file will be deleted.  See "YAML-Format" section for
details.

To catch user input python’s Tk (tkinter) library is used to create a
simple password input window.  The appropriate response is saved for
only 3 seconds by default to not have it exposed as soon as it’s used.
The utility also supports the input of any integer which is then used as
timer.  Otherwise the environment is searched for PWCLIPTIME and uses
the value of that environment variable as timer.  The timer is used as
time in which the received password stays in the paste buffer bevore its
replaced by the previously copied value.  As you may see there is an
optional commet which is used as text notification displayed on the
screen if set.  Therefor python3’s gi notify2 is used which is another
reason for discontinuing python2 support.

I highly encourage you to bind pwclip to a shortcut within your
X-Environment to have access to your stored passwords from within any
program.  For example i like binding it to ‘Super-Middle-Mouse-Button’
for the pwclip default mode and ‘Strg-Shift-Middle-Mouse-Button’ for the
yubico mode.  On Windows-Systems you need to create a link for it
somewhere.  When editing that link you may set a keyboard shortcut
(could not find a nicer solution by now).  The target for that link then
whould be "%PYTHONINSTALLDIR%\scripts\pwclip.exe".

Last but not least i want to point something out: I’ve been trying my
best to keep the passwords secure from unwanted access BUT there is !NO
GUARANTEE! that the passwords handled with during runtime are safe from
other users access, especially root access on linux systems (help on
that is very welcome).  Please be aware of that.

Since version 1.2 openssl keys are supported.  For use with pwclip they
will be converted to gpg-keys automaticly - openssl is not used for
en/decryption.

-------------------------

On Windows you need to install Python3 from ‘http://python.org/’ first.
On most Linux distributions python will be part of the system.  With
Python installed, you can install the pwclip package from the
Python-Package-Index (pyPI) by running:

‘pip3 install pwclip’

and installing the dependencies (not managed by pip) manually.

3.3.2 Installing from a source distribution archive
---------------------------------------------------

To install this package from a source distribution archive, do the
following:

  1. Extract all the files in the distribution archive to some directory
     on your system.

  2. In that directory, run: ‘python setup.py install’

3.4 Usage
=========

Although is was planed as GUI-Program it’s also possible to be executed
from terminals.  For Windows, Linux and OSX there is an appropriate
executable packed which might be executed like the following examples
will show:

* Menu:

* GPG-Mode::
* Yubikey-Mode::
* GUI-Mode::


File: pwclip.info,  Node: GPG-Mode,  Next: Yubikey-Mode,  Up: Usage

3.4.1 GPG-Mode
--------------

If there is an environment variable called GPGKEYS it will use those
keys to encrypt on changes to the password file.  To list the password
file you may use the list switch followed by optional search pattern
like:

‘pwcli -l’

or

‘pwcli -l $PATTERN’

as you can see the yaml format tends to be used for multiple user names
to better manage large lists.  By default the current users entrys will
be listed only.  To have them all listed (or searched for by the above
pattern example) use:

‘pwcli -A -l $PATTERN’


File: pwclip.info,  Node: Yubikey-Mode,  Next: GUI-Mode,  Prev: GPG-Mode,  Up: Usage

3.4.2 Yubikey-Mode
------------------

‘ykclip’

The YKSERIAL environment variable is used if found to select the yubikey
to use if more than one key is connected.  Otherwise the first one found
is chosen.  Likewise it also accepts an option:

‘pwcli -y $YKSERIAL’

To have it wait for a specific time like 60 seconds (bevore resetting
the paste buffer to the previously copied value) the PWCLIPTIME
environment variable is used or also the command accepts it as input:

‘pwcli -t 60 -l mysavedusername’

Most of the options may be combined.  For more information on possible
options in cli mode please see:

‘pwcli --help’


File: pwclip.info,  Node: GUI-Mode,  Prev: Yubikey-Mode,  Up: Usage

3.4.3 GUI-Mode
--------------

For the GUI-Mode just use one of the following commands, not accepting
any options or arguments:

‘pwclip’

‘ykclip’

3.5 Troubleshooting
===================

When using the yubikey challenge-response mode there is a bug in the
usb_hid interface.  This is because of python2 => 3 transition, most
likely and can be fixed easily (having root privileges) by executing the
following commands: ‘sudo su -’ # only needed if current user isn’t root
already ‘sudo vi +':107s/\(.* =\).*/\1 response[0]/' +':wq'
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/yubico/yubikey_4_usb_hid.py’
Explained: In line 107 of the file
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/yubico/yubikey_4_usb_hid.py the
ord() coversion of the response ‘r_len = ord(response[0])’ needs to be
removed, like: ‘r_len = response[0]’

3.6 Credits
===========

        * Python3 developers & the whole community (farmost those
          @stackoverflow.com)

        * Pyperclip for they excellent Windows & OSX clipboard code

        * Yubico (cheap & solid HW-Security-Modules) & python-yubico
          developers

        * GNU Privacy Guard (basic kryptography) & python-gnupg
          developers

        * SonicLux for telling me that a final version cannot and must
          not be 0.3.3 :D

I hope that this might be somewhat of help or at least be inspiring for
own ideas.  You’re alway welcome to leave me a message for requests,
review or feature/bug requests: <<d0n@janeiskla.de>>
